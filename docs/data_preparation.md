# 🧪 Data Preparation & Updated Input Reference

This page documents the **new preprocessing contract** for EveNet. The reference schema in
`share/event_info/pretrain.yaml` is bundled with the repository as an example, but you are free to adapt the feature
lists to match your campaign. The goal of this guide is to help you build the `.npz` files that the EveNet converter
ingests and to clarify how each tensor maps onto the model heads.

> ⚠️ **Ownership reminder:** Users are responsible for generating the `.npz` files. EveNet does not reorder or reshape
> features for you—the arrays must already follow the size and ordering implied by your event-info YAML. The converter
> simply validates the layout and writes the parquet outputs. Keep the YAML and the `.npz` dictionary in sync at all
> times.

## 🛠️ Config + CLI Workflow

1. **Start from an event-info YAML.** The repository ships an example at `share/event_info/pretrain.yaml`; copy or
   extend it to describe the objects, global variables, and heads you plan to enable. The display names inside the
   `INPUTS` block are just labels used for logging and plotting—what matters is the order, which **must** match the
   tensor layout you write to disk.
2. **Produce an event dictionary.** For every event, assemble a Python dictionary that satisfies the shapes described
   below and append it to the archive you will write to disk. When you call `numpy.savez` (or `savez_compressed`), each
   key becomes an array with leading dimension `N`, the number of events in the file. Masks indicate which padded
   entries are valid and should contribute to the loss.
3. **Run the EveNet converter.** Point `preprocessing/preprocess.py` at your `.npz` bundle and pass the matching YAML so
   the loader can recover feature names, the number of sequential vectors, and the heads you are enabling. The converter
   assumes both artifacts describe the same structure—mismatches will surface as validation errors.
4. **Train or evaluate.** Training configs reference the resulting parquet directory via `platform.data_parquet_dir` and
   reuse the same YAML in `options.Dataset.event_info`.

> ✨ **Normalization note.** The `normalize`, `log_normalize`, and `none` tags in the YAML are metadata only. EveNet
> derives channel-wise statistics during conversion. The sole special case is `normalize_uniform`, which reserves a
> transformation for circular variables (`φ`); the model automatically maps to and from the wrapped representation.

## 📦 Input Tensor Dictionary

Each event is described by the following feature tensors. Shapes are shown with a leading `N` to indicate the number of
stored events in a given `.npz` file. Masks share the same leading dimension as the value they gate.

| Key                      | Shape        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `num_vectors`            | `(N,)`       | Total count of global + sequential objects per event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `num_sequential_vectors` | `(N,)`       | Number of valid sequential entries per event. Mirrors `num_vectors` behaviour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `subprocess_id`          | `(N,)`       | Integer label identifying the subprocess drawn from the YAML metadata.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `x`                      | `(N, 18, 7)` | Point-cloud tensor storing exactly **18 slots** with **7 features each**. These dimensions are fixed so datasets can leverage the released pretraining weights. Order the features exactly as your YAML lists them (energy, `pT`, `η`, `φ`, b-tag score, lepton flag, charge in the example). Use padding for missing particles and mask them out via `x_mask`. |
| `x_mask`                 | `(N, 18)`    | Boolean (or `0/1`) mask indicating which particle slots in `x` correspond to real objects. Only entries with mask `1` contribute to losses and metrics.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `conditions`             | `(N, C)`     | Event-level scalars. `C` is the number of global variables you define (10 in the example). You may add or remove variables as long as the order matches your YAML; if you do not supply any conditions, drop the key entirely.                                                                                                                                  |
| `conditions_mask`        | `(N, 1)`     | Mask for `conditions`. Set to `1` when the global features are present. If you omit `conditions`, omit this mask as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## 🎯 Supervision Targets by Head

Only provide the tensors required for the heads you enable in your training YAML. Omit unused targets or set them to
empty arrays so the converter skips unnecessary storage.

### Classification Head

| Key              | Shape  | Meaning                                                                                                                                                           |
|------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `classification` | `(N,)` | Process label per event. Combine with `event_weight` for weighted cross-entropy when sampling imbalanced campaigns.                                               |
| `event_weight`   | `(N,)` | Optional per-event weight; defaults to `1` if omitted. Populate it alongside `classification` so the converter can broadcast the weights into the parquet shards. |

### TruthGeneration Head

| Key                   | Shape            | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `x_invisible`         | `(N, N_nu, F_nu)` | Invisible particle (e.g., neutrino) features. `N_nu` is the **maximum** number of invisible objects you intend to pad, `2` in the example, and `F_nu` is the number of features per invisible. Feature order is defined in your YAML under the TruthGeneration block. |
| `x_invisible_mask`    | `(N, N_nu)`      | Flags which invisible entries are valid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `num_invisible_raw`   | `(N,)`           | Count of all invisible objects before quality cuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `num_invisible_valid` | `(N,)`           | Number of invisible objects associated with reconstructed parents.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### ReconGeneration Head

ReconGeneration is self-supervised: it perturbs the visible point-cloud channels and learns to denoise them. The target
specification (which channels to regenerate) lives **directly in the YAML** under the ReconGeneration configuration. No
additional tensors beyond the standard inputs are required.

### Resonance Assignment Head

| Key                        | Shape       | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|----------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `assignments-indices`      | `(N, R, D)` | Resonance-to-child mapping. `R` is the number of resonances in the event (e.g., `len(global_config.event_info.event_particles[proc].names)`), and `D` is the maximum number of children over all resonances (scan `global_config.event_info.product_particles[proc][resonance].names`). Each entry stores indices drawn from the sequential inputs. |
| `assignments-mask`         | `(N, R)`    | Indicates whether **all** children for a given resonance were reconstructed.                                                                                                                                 |
| `assignments-indices-mask` | `(N, R, D)` | Per-child validity flags. Use `0` to pad absent daughters while keeping other children active.                                                                                                               |

> 📐 **Assignment internals:** During conversion EveNet scans your assignment map to determine `R` and `D`, initialises
> arrays filled with `-1`, and then writes the actual child indices along with boolean masks. The snippet below mirrors
> the loader logic so you can generate matching tensors in your own pipeline:

```python
full_indices = np.full((num_events, n_targets, max_daughters), -1, dtype=int)
full_mask = np.zeros((num_events, n_targets), dtype=bool)
index_mask = np.zeros((num_events, n_targets, max_daughters), dtype=bool)
# Fill with your resonance→daughter mappings; mark valid entries in the masks.
```

### Segmentation Head

| Key                       | Shape        | Meaning                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `segmentation-class`      | `(N, S, T)`  | One-hot daughter class per slot. `S` is the maximum number of daughters across resonances **plus one** reserved null slot (mirrors `D + 1` from assignments), and `T` is the number of resonance tags (e.g., `len(global_config.event_info.segmentation_indices)`). |
| `segmentation-data`       | `(N, S, 18)` | Assignment of each daughter slot to one of the 18 input particles used in the point cloud.                                       |
| `segmentation-momentum`   | `(N, S, 4)`  | Ground-truth four-momenta for the segmented daughters.                                                                           |
| `segmentation-full-class` | `(N, S, T)`  | Boolean indicator: `1` if all daughters of the resonance are reconstructed.                                                      |

As with assignments, the converter computes `S` and `T` by scanning your segment-tag map. The internal helper creates
zero-initialised arrays sized `(num_events, max_event_segments, max_segment_tags)` and fills them according to the
resonance definitions. Any slots you leave unused remain associated with the catch-all background class (`0`).

If you disable the segmentation head, you can skip all four tensors.

### Worked Input Example

```python
import numpy as np

example = {
    "x": np.zeros((N, 18, 7), dtype=np.float32),  # fixed to (18, 7) for pretraining compatibility
    "x_mask": np.zeros((N, 18), dtype=bool),
    # Optional globals — drop both keys if unused
    "conditions": np.zeros((N, C), dtype=np.float32),
    "conditions_mask": np.ones((N, 1), dtype=bool),
    # Classification head (weights default to ones if omitted)
    "classification": np.zeros((N,), dtype=np.int32),
    "event_weight": np.ones((N,), dtype=np.float32),
    # Head-specific entries sized by your resonance/segment definitions
    "assignments-indices": np.full((N, R, D), -1, dtype=int),
    "assignments-mask": np.zeros((N, R), dtype=bool),
    "segmentation-data": np.zeros((N, S, 18), dtype=bool),
    # ... add heads you enabled ...
}
```

Feel free to adjust the head-specific dimensions (`R`, `D`, `S`, `T`) and the number of condition scalars `C` to match
your physics process. The only fixed sizes are the point-cloud slots `(18, 7)` shared across datasets. Keep the YAML and
the `.npz` dictionary in sync so the converter knows how many channels to expect and how to name them.

---

<a id="npz--parquet-conversion"></a>

## 🔄 NPZ → Parquet Conversion

1. **Assemble events** into Python lists and save them with `numpy.savez` (or `savez_compressed`). Each key listed above
   becomes an array inside the archive.
2. **Invoke the converter**:

   ```bash
   python preprocessing/preprocess.py \
     share/event_info/pretrain.yaml \
     --in_npz /path/to/events.npz \
     --store_dir /path/to/output \
     --cpu_max 32
   ```

   The converter reads the YAML to recover feature names, masks, and head activation flags, then emits:

    - `data_*.parquet` containing flattened tensors.
    - `shape_metadata.json` with the original shapes (e.g., `(18, 7)` for `x`).
    - `normalization.pt` with channel-wise statistics and class weights.

3. **Inspect the logs.** The script reports how many particles, invisible objects, and resonances were valid across the
   dataset—helpful when debugging mask alignment.

<a id="runtime-checklist"></a>

## ✅ Runtime Checklist

- `platform.data_parquet_dir` points to the folder with the generated parquet shards and `shape_metadata.json`.
- `options.Dataset.event_info` references the same YAML (`share/event_info/pretrain.yaml` or your copy).
- `options.Dataset.normalization_file` matches the `normalization.pt` produced during conversion.
- Only the heads you activated in the training YAML have matching supervision tensors in the parquet files.

With those pieces in place, EveNet will rebuild the full event dictionary on the fly, apply the appropriate circular
normalization for `normalize_uniform` channels, and route each tensor to the corresponding head.
